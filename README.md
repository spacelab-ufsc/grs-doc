## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the UFSC ground station developed by SpaceLab, detailing its architecture, components, and operational capabilities. Designed to support ongoing satellite missions, the ground station features a robust and flexible system for reliable signal transmission and reception across multiple frequency bands. It's key features are:

* **Multi-band antenna systems** (VHF, UHF, S-Band) mounted on an azimuth/elevation rotor for precise satellite tracking.
* **Integrated protection and amplification** with surge protectors, LNAs, and PAs to ensure signal integrity.
* **Software Defined Radios (SDRs)** for versatile signal processing.
* **Remote operation and monitoring** via a central server.
